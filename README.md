 # About Me
 ðŸ‘‹ Hey there everyone, my online alias is @NotBlasto, but everyone just calls me Justin. I am a self-motivated student and programmer with a life-long passion for computers and technology. I'm a current Computer Software Technology 
 major in my Senior year at The University of Arizona Global Campus and while I have spent some time doing software development, my true passion is in data science and analytics.
 I also love video games as you may probably see from some of my repositories, and recently I've thoroughly enjoyed merging my love for data, with my love for video games.
 You can find my Exploratory Data Analysis on the impact of consecutively winning in League of Legends here on Github or Tableau. I hope to get a comprehensive write up of the project written on Kaggle soon as well.
