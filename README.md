 # About Me
 ðŸ‘‹ Hey there everyone, my online alias is @NotBlasto, but everyone just calls me Justin. I am a self-motivated student and programmer who developed a huge passion for data, optimization, and automation. I'm a current Computer Software Technology major in my Senior year at The University of Arizona Global Campus, and while I have spent some time doing software development, my true passion is in Data Science and Analytics. To build my experience, I finished IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate where I predicted the [launch outcomes](https://github.com/NotBlasto/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project) of SpaceX missions, and shortly after I decided to deploy a useful little [data science tool](https://notblasto-data-science-web-app-application-10g331.streamlit.app/) to help streamline a few large aspects of the data science lifecycle. If you're curious about the source code, you can find that in [this repository](https://github.com/NotBlasto/Data-Science-Web-App). 
 
I also love video games as you may probably see from some of my repositories, and recently I've thoroughly enjoyed merging my love for data, with my love for video games.
If you're interested, you can find my Exploratory Data Analysis on the impact of consecutively winning in League of Legends here on [Github](https://github.com/NotBlasto/League-Of-Legends-LP-EDA) and [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/justin.stewart3367/viz/LoLLPGainEDA/LeagueofLegendsLPGainEDA?publish=yes). I hope to get a comprehensive write up of the project written on Kaggle soon as well.
